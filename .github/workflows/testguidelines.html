<h1>Guidelines for suggesting images</h1>
<ul>
<li>1st. don't post anything innapropiate. its very weird and disgusting.</li>
<li>2nd. don't post anything suggestive about a user for blankpace. they didnt even do anything</li> 
<li>3rd. don't place any links leading to virus downloads or gambling sites. gambling is a huge problem in some
countries.</li>
<li>4th. don't use ai. no matter how bad you are, you can use scratch or adobe fresco for art if you want.</li>
<li>5th. you can suggest a video or a sound, but you cant suggest an .exe file,.bat file,vbs file, or .pdf file because they are unrelated.</li>
<li>6th. you can suggest pages, but dont make a html file to show how you want it. we will do it ourselves. but don't worry, 
you wont get banned.</li>
<li>7th. no predators. we want this site to be safe for anyone but predators.</li>
<li>8th. you can add swear words, but don't add slurs like the nword, etc.</li>
<li>9th. don't clown on anyone. same with the 2nd rule, but without images.</li>
<li>10th. you can leak any features. but don't do this for 100 times. just 1 time then you can do it again in 1 day.</li>
